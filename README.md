This system also enables them to follow their examination schedule and receive reminders.it allows them to book an appointment for an examination with an available doctor and follow the results of their examinations and the notes from the treating physician remotely.

This website will provide the ability to purchase medicine by simply scanning the QR code on their recovery card.
